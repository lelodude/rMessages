### About the developer

My name is Lawrence, I go with Lelo. I have a premium Minecraft server 'Destinycraft.servegame.com' (DestinyCraft) with
a website 'http://destinycraft.info/'. I've recently became a Minecraft plugin developer and will try my best, because I
plan on becoming an expert Minecraft java coder in the future :P

I'm currently studying in college and dedicate my time into coding as the same time which is tough.
