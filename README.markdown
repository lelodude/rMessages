### About the developer

My name is Kyle Clemens. I run a cracked [Minecraft server](http://royalcraf.tk) at royalcraf.tk, write (currently) four different plugins: RoyalCommands, RoyalChat, RoyalMessages, and RoyalMisc.
RoyalMisc is only available on RoyalCraft.

I currently attend school and hope to continue learning Java to better this plugin.
