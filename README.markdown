### About the developer

My name is Lawrence, I go with Lelo. I run a minecraft premium server 'destinycraft.servegame.com' (DestinyCraft) you're welcome to join.

I'm currently studying in college and try to dedicate my time into working on this plugin and running my server. It's tough, but gaming
is my thing, I will never lose interest :)
